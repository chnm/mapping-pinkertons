├── src/               # Description
│   ├── components/    # Description
│   ├── pages/         # Description
│   ├── api/           # Description

## Architecture

<!--
Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture.
Explain how major components interact and data flows through the system.
-->

### System Architecture Diagram

<!--
Include a visual representation of the system architecture.
Use Mermaid diagrams or describe the architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client/Browser] --> B[Frontend App]
    B --> C[API Layer]
    C --> D[Business Logic]
    D --> E[Database]
    C --> F[External APIs]
```

Explain:
- Major system components and their responsibilities
- How data flows between components
- External service integrations
- Deployment architecture (if relevant)
-->

### Database Diagram 

### Database Schema Diagram

<!--
Generate a visual representation of the database schema.

If a database exists, analyze the project files to infer structure.
Sources may include:
- Django models
- ORM models
- SQL schema files
- Migration files (e.g., db/migrations/)
- Schema dumps
- Declarative model definitions

Output a Mermaid ER diagram like:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ ORDER_ITEM : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ ORDER_ITEM : included_in
```

Rules:
- Only include domain fields (omit framework internals like Django's id defaults, timestamps unless explicitly defined).
- Show primary keys and foreign keys.
- Infer relationships (1–1, 1–many, many–many).
- Use singular entity names.
- Normalize naming if source names are inconsistent.
- If uncertain, make best inference and note assumptions.

After the diagram, explain:

- Each table/model and its purpose
- Relationships between entities
- Key constraints and indexes
- Derived or computed fields (if any)
- Assumptions or inferred structure
- Potential schema concerns or improvements (optional)

If no database is detected, state:
"No database schema detected in project."
-->

### REST API Design

<!--
Document API design patterns and conventions:
- Base URL structure: /api/v1/...
- Resource naming: plural nouns (e.g., /users, /posts)
- HTTP methods and their usage:
  - GET: Retrieve resources
  - POST: Create new resources
  - PUT/PATCH: Update resources
  - DELETE: Remove resources
- Response format standards (JSON structure, metadata, pagination)
- Error response format (status codes, error messages, error codes)
- Versioning strategy
- Common query parameters: ?page=, ?limit=, ?sort=, ?filter=
- Common headers: Authorization, Content-Type, etc.

Example endpoint documentation format:
GET /api/v1/users/:id
- Description: Retrieve a user by ID
- Auth required: Yes
- Response: { "id": 1, "name": "...", ... }
-->
